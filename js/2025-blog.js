  "2025-1-1": "First off, Happy New Year to everyone! I got the website up just in time for the New Year and had to stay up a little late yesterday night to finish adding the links to the footer page and link the static site to github.io (I realized that I would have to use another server after creating a dynamic website since Github Pages only allow static).\n\nToday, I woke up at 9 AM and had some family time for the New Year. Each New Year, it was like a “tradition” for us to go to the mall and shop for the New Year. We went to San Francisco Premium Outlets and went around to see if there was anything nice to buy. In previous years, I bought a new jacket for the new year. Unfortunately, this year, the price seemed a little too hefty, and the quality and design didn’t seem worth it. I had honeydew milk tea with boba and lychees, that was something new, and honestly, it didn’t taste half bad. I went to another mall afterward, had fun in the arcade, and won some rewards from the claw machines. For dinner I had some Porky's Pizza, I haven't had them in years and bought the porky combo topping, it was very delicious. Probably not going to have a day like this until next year, but it was fun while it lasted.\n\nFor website improvement, I want to create a commenting system like some web blogs. Unfortunately, since the website is static I might have to go to Google Forms and link to Google sheet style for commenting. Hopefully, I can get it by Friday, but if not, most likely before school starts on the 7th.",
  "2025-1-2": "I woke up to go for a mile run, and got a 6:50 . Didn’t expect to run slower than the average for a 3 mile a couple months ago. Today was like a usual break day for me. I went to the library and studied whatever I wanted to know more about. I forgot that I had an AP World assignment to do so today. Worked until 6:30 and came back home.\n \nI finished the commenting system as you guys can see above. It’s not the coolest commenting system, but it gets the work done with a static website. Hope you guys comment on some of the blogs.",
  "2025-1-3": "Today was more or less the same as yesterday half the day. Woke up early to get a little reading done and then went to the library until 1. My brother wanted to go to the theater all of the sudden so we went to the nearest one in Bay Fair. We chose Sonic The Hedgehog 3 which everyone was watching. Personally, Sonic was corny and the end of the movie (no spoiler) was shocking a little, I didn't expect those characters to sacrifice themself. Got little headed the way home and took a mile run again. \n\nLittle excited for tomorrow, kickoff is going to start for FRC, can’t wait to see what this year's game is about.",
  "2025-1-4": "This year's kickoff for Robotic seems more complex than last year's crescendo game. At first, I won’t lie, I thought we were going to play the challenge on water (which would have been cool), but it was pretty unlikely and hard. This year's FRC challenge consisted of taking “algae” (playground bouncy ball” out of “coral reef” and to score “coral” (cylinder shape game pieces) on the “reef sticks” or scoring on the “processor” area. Overall it was very cool thinking of ideas with the team about which feature we should be planning on doing. It's challenging this year because as a team, we have to find a way to score, either with the algae or coral, then hang on cages to earn even more points. I believe we have an idea of how we want to score this year. Most likely with the coral and a cool hanging mechanism. I personally think coral is still pretty important, but something about letting other opposite scores persuade me to not have the robot solely score just algae. But who knows, maybe it is harder to score on the net than I think, but it seems simple enough.",
  "2025-1-5": "Today was Sunday and that meant Boyscout in the morning. We did requirements for ranking up, but since I have to wait for mine to sign off in a few months, it was pretty boring for me and helping other scouts sign off some requirements. Went to the library like usual and then played in the park for a while. Trying to remember AP World topics and memorize the rules for Reefscape to hopefully become a driver.",
  "2025-1-6": "Today was pretty boring. It was a Monday and no school yet until tomorrow. Decided to study for AP World. I didn't know if the test was going to be tomorrow or not. Had a text at night that the test is on Wednesday instead of Tuesday. So I was just in the library the whole day nearly. I did see a person in robotics that came in the morning and finished the rule test in order to be considered a driver.  Hopefully, tomorrow isn’t going to be bad coming back to school.",
  "2025-1-7": "Today, I went back to school. Honestly, it was really boring and I learned the same thing as usual, but I did find out that the test was on Wednesday so I had to lock in after school. Came to the library and tried to finish some club work and also study for AP World. Good luck to those taking the test too.",
  "2025-1-8": "Today, I had the double AP Test and had a usual day at school. However, we did have our first robotic after school meeting this year. It was longer than I remember and we struggled thinking of an idea that is effective for cost and the game design. Overall, today was alright.",
  "2025-1-9": "Today was another normal day at school except the classes are shorter. I was pretty excited to give my robot design idea for the after school meeting, however due to a power outage, it got canceled. Put my idea in the basecamp however and hopefully people know what I’m talking about.",
  "2025-1-10": "Today there was no school, which was nice. However, I’m not going to lie, I did not get much done as I got side tracked very easily. Hopefully, this does not happen ever again. I did go to the dentist in the afternoon and unexpectedly saw a school friend.",
  "2025-1-11": "Today was Saturday and I was a little worried since I have not touched a quizlet set for the Ming dynasty, however I did look over the terms and read them since it was interesting so I should be fine. Went to the robotic meeting today and not going to lie, it was kinda boring, but we finally decided on what to design for the robot which is nice. Was glad to come home and begin coding some programs for the website later.",
  "2025-1-12": "Today I went to a boy scout as usual. However, we learn new things rather than doing old requirement signing. There was a nurse that came from Oakland to teach us about first aid. How to apply pressure to stop someone from bleeding to death and using a tourniquet/rubber version. Went straight to the library right after because I really needed to get my studying in before Tuesday's test.",
  "2025-1-13": "Today I went to school and did my usual things. There was some teacher absent for some reason, but other than that nothing new. After school robotic meeting was more or less the same as the class where we tried to CAD out the design. Might have spent 30 minutes reverting the changes that I deleted accidentally but in the end I finished organizing the CAD design.",
  "2025-1-14": "Today was boring, however I did get time to get some reading and fix my calculator. For some reason, the calculator screen won’t show the x and y axis. I searched up online and realized that somehow in the format screen display so many buttons had changed and I’m pretty sure I haven’t messed with them. The Robot meeting was the same as yesterday, but with more members. My lead was telling me to make more cards for what we have to do in the season and that was not fun. I got to catch up on some reading in math however.",
  "2025-1-15": "Today, school was normal (other than our pride won like 8 pizza boxes for 30 people). I update my computer with the WPILIB VsCode essential to program with my computer instead of the laptop that runs VERY slowly that robotic has. It was a big update as I was able to practice and re-visite how to use the library and method that the package provides for the motor-controller and also other cool stuff. During Robotic, I have finished rewriting the C++ code in Java for the subsystem base for the drivebase and also the lifter. Since C++ is different from Java I have to figure out a brake system for the sparkmaxs so the motor stops when I need it to. Today was pretty productive and I learned some stuff.\n\nI heard some complaints on how to use the commenting system, I might have to underline it better so people know where to click to comment. Also the month blog (come on guys it's right there with a link).",
  "2025-1-16": "Today, school was normal as usual. Had some chemistry tests that I totally forgot to study for, but since chem is easy for me and we had a good teacher. Speaking of good teachers, I was very surprised that my chemistry teacher was so good at basketball. We had a winter rally for the sports teams as usual every year (teacher vs student) and out of the 11 points (everything counts as 1) that was scored she made 4 (with 5 attempts). Not going to lie, the game wasn’t as good as last year since there was no dunk and the crazy amount of 3 point air-balls was not nice in the first quarter.\n\nAfter school, I went to the dentist and saw another good cross-country friend there. The dentist was kind of quick and a little bit sloppy with the job. My teeth were bleeding after that, but what is done is done. Tomorrow, I’m going camping until Saturday so you guys might not see what I’m thinking or doing for Friday.",
  "2025-1-17": "Friday was a nightmare in the morning. I have been procrastinating on what I should be studying for. Wasting time and stressing out for which test to study on was not cool. Everything went well for all the tests (arm cramp during LEQ no problem), but in spanish the test, one question wrong which brought it down to a 91%. The question I got wrong was kind of BS as it talks about what you do after bathe and I put “I go to sleep”. Apparently it's wrong, and the Spanish teacher says you have to talk about the “routine” which is from morning to night (which did not say in the test, it just said routines they like to take), and the correct answer is to shave which would have made sense if the instruction was clearer.\n\nCouldn’t go to the robotic meeting which was kinda sad since I didn’t want to camp at night which was cold as hell. It was for a volunteer meeting for boy scouts which I have to do for my badge since I don’t know what other time they are ever going to host this type of volunteer event (supposedly it needs to be a conservation project, approved by the landowner). I set up camp below the mountains, away from the smoke rising up which everyone else was camping at. Hopefully I don’t catch a cold.",
  "2025-1-18": "Woke up like 4-5 times yesterday night/today. Obviously it got colder and less cold each time of the day and it drove me crazy. I think I woke up at 11:00ish, 1ish, 3ish, and 6ish. Each time I was complaining about my sleeping position or whether it was too hot or cold. I heard other people didn’t get enough sleep or even less sleep which I probably shouldn’t be complaining about.\n\nThe conservation project at camp was just collecting flammable pieces of material and actually burning them in a “safe” organized area so it doesn’t spread. It was fun and stuff, seeing things burn, but in return I had to find the material to burn. And apparently, almost during lunch, some fire department came over and said that we aren’t allowed to burn cause it was a “no burning day” for the area. After lunch (had hamburgers with rubber fries), we went and gathered material to burn later. Me and my scout had some fun trying to cut open a semi-big tree log, but with little success until one of the scout rangers demonstrated it and got the work done. Then it was 4 PM and I was glad we could go home. I Arrived around 5:30 and went straight to work on the new projector I brought to maybe limit my time on blue light and perhaps watch some films. Today was just very tiring.",
  "2025-1-19": "Today, my arm and thumb were sore as hell. I think it was the ax chopping during the camp and it felt kinda swollen. But today the boy scout meeting was just ice skating. Honestly I did feel like going since I had studied and tried some new programs, but in the end I decided to take a break for once. During the skating rink, my skate did not feel right, I was unstable and felt like falling. I knew how to ice skate and it was similar to roller skating so I was confused. I thought it might have to do something with the shoe so I switched it out and I then realized after a while that I had swapped the left shoe with the right and vice versa. After realizing my mistake and going back to the ring, I felt way better and I didn’t lose control. I spent the next hour and half trying to figure out how to skate backward and I think I got the idea. Spent the rest of the day in the library and reading my AP world note so I can actually work on robotic stuff tomorrow without stressing too much on the test for tuesday.",
  "2025-1-20": "Went to robotic today and went straight to work like usual. Apparently all the work I did a week ago was mixed up, some of the code of the subsystem should have been in the command and I had to figure out what method to include in the subsystem to call in the execution command. Was very painful for me, but as long as I get practice and not F up on the real robot, I’m glad to take that long. Also had some painful experience playing bedwar with some sweaty try hard after two win streak games. Studying right now and hope to finish by 9 so I can sleep.",
  "2025-1-21": "Normal day for school as always. Took the regular test, did some robotic stuff. Wish we had time to work on the website more, but priority is necessary.",
  "2025-1-22": "Very upset today, I lost something that I love to use in school. Why does people like to steal stuff, like come on, you can live without still school stuff man. I will find the thief and I hope he/she knows I will find them. Too angry to write anything for today.",
  "2025-1-23": "I found my calculator today. Very good news and happy since I didn’t want to buy a new one and have a math test tomorrow. School was alright, I heard there was a small fight and got work done. Robotics was alright and I finished everything I needed to do and went home to study for a big test tomorrow. I pray I pass the Spanish test because I didn’t do well last time.",
  "2025-1-24": "I failed my Spanish test, not happy and got worse news on my other tests. I think I’m going to take some time to regain my confidence. Today senior night was a fire though, which brought my mood up a little. Shout out to both boy and girl varsity for winning over 20+ points.",
  "2025-1-25": "Today was a pretty fun day. It was Mr. K's birthday and all of us celebrated and “surprised” him. I think he knew we were up to something already though. The party was organized as some people led him out to the shed to get things and everyone else set up for the celebration. I had a party explosion launching things and celebrated for the next hour and so until we got to work. Not much was done because I finished everything already, however there was a problem in our design so we had to find another one which was kinda painful since we are going backward not forward into the season, but things had to be done. I have to CAD my design however and print it in a miniature figure which I don’t want to do. But overall it was a fun day.",
  "2025-1-26": "Today was physically painful. For this week's boy scout meeting we have to do a 12 mile hike which I was not prepared for. I realized I was not in shape 3 months ago as my foot hurt after 8 miles. Willie made us walk a full circle around the whole lake. I thought surely it wasn't 12 miles, but when we got back it was around 12 which I was in disbelief. I think I will go back to do more running and sprinting later. Gonna study AP World now.",
  "2025-1-27": "Today, I went back to school and nothing new happened. There was a badminton competition that I attended and won the first game. I’m starting the finance club soon and I ask people to fill out the form. Very excited to revive the club because I think many people are as interested in finance as I am. So far the lead for what we are doing the first day is stock so far. Robotic being normal, had some trouble figuring how to convert the joystick angle from the gyroscope code.",
  "2025-1-28": "Got a lot of response for the finance club that I’m reviving, pretty good start so far. I gather some information up on stocks and start to add it into the slide. Hopefully, I get everything and don’t get bambozol with questions I don’t know. Finish cading out the onshape design by 1/12 of the robot size, but it wasn’t the best and symmetrical to size so I gotta fix that up later. Overall, today was alright.",
  "2025-1-29": "First off, Happy Chinese New Year! All those that celebrate, hope you guys got a lot of red envelopes. Totally forgot tomorrow would be Thursday, that means all my tests on Friday would be on Thursday instead which means a lot of cramming notes. Today was not a bad day, pretty normal except the fact that my studying pattern has changed so that's a problem. I started waking up at 6 lately and personally I think it's great for my physical and mental health. I feel more focused in the morning and notes come to me like glue. I think I’m going to stick with that habit even during the weekend.",
  "2025-1-30": "Nothing major today, school was fine and stuff, woke up at 6 and did some studying. Apparently, just reading the definition and trying to get everything I know about the term is good enough for my definition test, so no need to cramp or stress. Robotic I copy Matthew code to the drivebase, I’m still going to try and interpret it so in the future I won’t have to look back and ask myself what the hell it means. From now on, I’m going to study for the ACT/SAT. I'm a fool thinking I have time. I think I would like to take it during winter this year.",
  "2025-1-31": "It’s Friday and I don’t have school, which was very nice for me. I did do some ACT work and I think I did pretty well, but not satisfied with what I did on the practice ACT English section, I believe I could have done better. The pacing is the problem, I just realized that I spent double the amount of time I took on the question than I should have, which means bad pacing. I think I’m going to change that up with the reading section and the English one again later. I finished my Spanish project with one problem I haven’t solved yet but I think I got it. Haven’t got started on the finance club slide, but I’m for sure working on it tomorrow. Pretty productive today.",
  "2025-2-1": "Welp, it’s a new month and I successfully blogged for one month which is good. I went pretty much robotically for the whole day today. We had too much pizza left over and I don’t think there were a lot of people that came. I worked on the finance club slide when I had time, but in the end we had to pick a robot design. Yeah, we are kinda late on schedule, but we had to take some necessary steps back. We rocked with Eduardo design in the end as it provides the most reliable way to pick up the algae. I still like my idea, but I guess we didn’t like the arm mechanism which looked similar to Keith the beef (mechanical mayhem design).\n\nI finished reading Tomodachi Game, and personally I really like the book. 10/10 for sure and it sort of showed me some dark side of people, but also the good side. You guys should totally read it, the plot in the end was so unexpected. The ending wasn’t the best, but there was a deeper understanding in the picture than I thought.",
  "2025-2-2": "Today, I don't feel well. But that didn’t stop my family from going on a trip to some religious place and praying. There were a lot of people praying that day too. After coming back, I notice that my body is about to fall apart. My leg started getting tired and my eyes started swelling. I have a cold right now and let you guys know when I get better.",
  "2025-2-3": "Got a little better and went to school. After chemistry, my temperature went up to 102 F which was not good. I went back home and rested. Hopefully tomorrow is better.",
  "2025-2-4": "So tired right now it's not even funny, my head hurt and had nothing to do at robotics. Nothing to say because I caught a cold again.",
  "2025-2-5": "Went back to school and got caught, I’m actually about to crash out cause I have a test on spanish and ap world. I redid my test since I didn’t do it on tuesday. I was quite lucky that my terms were easy so it went smoothly, hopefully I can study a little since my head hurts less.",
  "2025-2-6": "Did the chemistry test with no problem, 23/23 on the test. School was normal and my head started to clear off since I finally got 5 hours of sleep, yipee. I think I know how a full time programmer feels now.",
  "2025-2-7": "I told myself, I’m going to take the chance and do the Spanish and AP world test. All luck by the way, the test question was easy. “Lady of fortune” has “smiled” upon me I guess. No robotics, but gotta prepare for the next quizlet and study for the ACT.",
  "2025-2-8": "Wow, I turned 16 today. Not much happened though, I had a few birthday wishes from good friends but other than that it was a normal day to be honest. It was robotic however and it was kinda stump since we didn’t have a lot to do.  No cake either since I thought it was not a big deal.",
  "2025-2-9": "I feel so much better after being sick. During boyscout today, we just went on doing little activity to get ready for the camporee. We made paper airplanes, did silent communication, and worked on tying ropes and creating structure out of them. In my patrol there were a lot of new scouts so it was nice learning how to teach them what to do.  I ran and exercised myself with my personal workout. I go jump rope for like 100 times then do sprints and repeat the process.",
  "2025-2-10": "Well, back to school again. Work on some AP world quizlet since I didn’t touch it until yesterday. But this week we are doing the DBQ which would not be fun. I sucked at the last DBQ quiz as I only was able to write 2 paragraphs, meaning not good time management. Hopefully I do better next time. However, robotics was kinda interesting and fun. I started working on the autonomous period with a friend, and had some fun struggling and figuring out the robot code. I think we got it, but didn’t have enough time to test it. Maybe tomorrow.",
  "2025-2-11": "Alright, early morning and we got straight to testing. And the code worked, we were able to make the robot go forward 3 ft, yippee. However, now, Matthew wants us to make a code where we intake the notes and shoot it out of Scar2D which stumps us on his code. We did some tinkering and apparently someone didn’t uncomment the command which would call the autonomous command in the robot container. We got it to work and fired the note afterschool which was nice.",
  "2025-2-12": "Just a lot of rain today. Not fun, all we did in robotics was work on the website which was not much either. I do need to get studying for the test on World War 1. During school there was another fight, like come on guys, why you guys have to fight in the rain like it ain’t that deep. However, good news, shoutout to a friend for letting me know of a cool website where I can learn courses for what I want to learn.",
  "2025-2-13": "Welp, rain again. During school however, there was an earthquake that I did not feel. They said it happened 2 times today and I did not feel anything. I might cook if a real earthquake came out of nowhere. Robotic, there was not a lot to work on except the website, I got text from Issac for the history page, but I still need old images. Really need to get working in the AP world and study for algebra 2 (I really did not touch math when studying).",
  "2025-2-14": "Happy Valentine's Day to you all. I, of course, did not receive any, but that's alright. I did a math test and later AP World. The DBQ was horrible, my time management was bad and without the Success Guide that Mr. McNulty gave, I might have been cooking and lost 20 minutes of typing. During AP World, our teacher gave out chocolate for Valentine Day’s, however, the chocolate had no sugar which meant bitter as heck. That gave me an idea and gave some chocolate out to people as pranks and don’t worry, these people I get along with so they are chill.",
  "2025-2-15": "Today I went to robotics and it was frustrating since I didn’t like onshape. We are pretty behind in making the robot so I had to help out mechanical with the robot. For the triangle base shooting mechanism base, we have to make a custom base bracket for the tubes. Had some trouble making the onshape model because specifically we had to create a sheet metal onshape model. Overall the meeting was alright though.",
  "2025-2-16": "Today I went to boy scout, we did some orienteering practice with the compass, frisbee throwing, and nature. Personally I love the orienteering practice with the compass as I get to choose how my patrol is going to move with my choice of orienteering. After that it was kinda boring, just went to the library and worked on code and other work.",
  "2025-2-17": "Today I went to robotics quite early, had to fix up the bracket once more and attach it to the main robot. Honestly, Onshape has been a pain the whole time. I finally figured out why the bracket is glitching in the main model of the robot. As my suspicion was correct, the angle of the bracket was off by 2 degrees. Did some basic math on triangles and fixed that. Went to work on the vex kit afterward, but the team captain wanted to wait a little on it with a plan first. Finish early and help out mechanical with the cannon. Yeah, our robotics is very behind as we should be done already, but we are prototyping, hopefully we are going to finish in time. Nah, we are going to finish in time.",
  "2025-2-18": "I was a little bummed today thinking we are going to have our robotic meeting today, but unfortunately it got canceled. I was thinking of creating a different degree of bracket because apparently the 45 degree bracket would interfere with the wheel, instead I’m thinking of shrinking it so it’s away from the wheel. I think I’m going to do the math today and figure out the rest of onshape tomorrow or something. It was semi-productive today, but I think I should have done more ACT practice rather than watching basketball anime.",
  "2025-2-19": "Today, I got work done. Went on a run in the morning and I’m starting to realize, I’m gaining weight again which ain’t good. Went to the library afterward and started studying AP world and ACT science sections. I finished watching the basketball anime and it was pretty cool. The rest of library time was just finishing up my merit badge for scout. Hopefully, my merit badge counselor approves my work and I finish the badge.",
  "2025-2-20": "Today, nothing much happened except it was the day I got started on actually studying for AP world after doing other things over break. Went in the library and studied for a while and got bored and did other things. After going to the library I went back home and had a meeting with my patrol scouts. Had to think of a mario theme skit which was not fun. However, I think we got it on lock since we are going to recreate the OG video game of mario. Shouldn’t be too hard right?",
  "2025-2-21": "Wow, it's Friday already, nothing much again except I got working on the bracket for robotics, just getting the calculation so we can go straight to work on it on Sunday. Also finish registering for the eagle camp for late June. After finishing the eagle camp, I would be done with all my merit badge which means eagle rank won’t be too far off to get like I thought 2 years ago. That also means I have to make my resume for my life rank soon. Went to play in the park after the library ended and I developed a cool basketball shot to shoot behind the backboard. Might be stupid, but who can guard that?",
  "2025-2-22": "Today, I went to the Pinewood Derby for boyscout volunteer. I met a school friend that was working for the OA which was nice talking to him. The competition is kinda boring as the cars just race down the ramp. However, I gotta give props to those that made the design. There was one that looked like a cyber truck, one that had eagle wings, and a cucumber race car. Lasted like 5 hours which was not fun. Went back to the library to study and went back home to work on spanish. I really hope that my Spanish grade goes back to a 98% at least.",
  "2025-2-23": "Today was the real boy scout meeting. We went to the US Coast Guard ship. It was heck cool looking at the thing the ship has. It had a huge “cannon” in one of the ships and a defensive turban that shot 1000 shots a minute according to the tour guy. However after that I went to Robotic where I fixed the bracket and everything by the end of the day. Hopefully, we can 3D print it by tomorrow.",
  "2025-2-24": "Same school experience, however I got a Spanish test that I believe I have a crush on which I really need. All my grades are at 100% except for Spanish because I mess up reading the instructions for one of the sections of the test. However, with 3 tests I definitely passed, I should be fine now. Robotic, I got the 3D print part done and people started launching the prototype ball up. All the dimensions of the robot should be correct which is good and the spark maxes are all updated well. Gonna 3D print the rest of the bracket for the robot base.",
  "2025-2-25": "School is the same as usual, I kinda sprain my ankle however playing basketball. However, robotic I am able to get things rolling as we got our bracket to be correct and now we are 3D printing. I hope my fellow programmer math was correct, but I have faith and trust.",
  "2025-2-26": "School was the same as usual. One of the teacher’s people died so that was a little awkward in class, but I hope they are alright. Couldn’t sell today, pretty bummed since our teacher didn’t email the office about selling, but we will be selling two weeks from now. And as for robotics, we have the bracket finish, marked, drilled, and tested out. Very glad it works and that means that we should be able to send the design of the bracket to fabwork to print. Still haven’t studied for AP World yet, but I’m a chill guy so I should be fine, I hope.",
  "2025-2-27": "School was again, but robotics is starting to make me go crazy. Not in a bad way obviously, just there is so much to be done and so little people show up. Finish making the bracket which was nice and finish drilling and stuff. But in the end when our mentor checked, apparently it didn’t work out because the angle was bad and it wouldn't reach the intake system which meant we had to rethink and redesign our idea. I am working on the angle battery holder system too because gotta help out if we are very behind. The bracket is similar to mine, but just made it work with the battery holder that rev gave us too. Hopefully, it won’t be too hard to finish.",
  "2025-2-28": "School, same as usual, took the test for ap and now got a study guide to finish. Played basketball and apparently I am washed as hell. Nothing much since it isn’t robotic, but I am still studying for my ACT and I try to find a design for the new robot I guess. That reminds me I should probably get a textbook for a bio later when I return my books.",
  "2025-3-1": "Second month of blogging has finished, wow. Saturday went robotic and went to work on the design of the robot tower. Got a rough design of the new tower design and started taking out the old bracket design from the robot. I think I’m going to take Scar2D idea and apply it on the robot tower without making custom bracket I think.",
  "2025-3-2": "Today I went to boyscout and did knot tying and skit planning. Was pretty boring, but robotics started to make me depressed to be honest. Apparently, I can’t actually take Scar2D fully, I would still need to create another custom bracket but they would have to be vertical up instead of a parallelogram. Spent like 3 hours to figure out a design until I gave up and just made a custom bracket. Still going to use half of the ScarD2 design but with a custom bracket that isn’t at an angle. Using 3 metal tubes instead of just 2 to connect them.",
  "2025-3-3": "Today I started actually studying for the AP world. Nothing serious and school was normal. Apparently our bracket is good and approved by our mentor so we should be able to start working tomorrow on the tower and be finished. Hopefully we can finish tomorrow, gotta study.",
  "2025-3-4": "Finishing the AP exam today was bad as hell for the MCQ. I might have been panicking too much and got some questions wrong. Barely anyone came to robotics as everyone said the AP World Mock Exam got them cooked. I should have left too, but I guess I want the robot to work.",
  "2025-3-5": "Nothing much except we are going to get the tower up in the robot. Nothing cool happened in school, but I heard there were going to be so many tests coming up. I might be stuck for a test for the next two days. I doubt that is the worst that will happen in my highschool year though since I’m going to take so many AP classes next year.\n\nThe Robot was fine today I guess, got the measurement ready and hopefully we can finish the tower by tomorrow. I kinda fail my drill training and our safety captain ain’t giving me a chance until Saturday, hopefully I can play with the drill more than just staring at the computer (yet we still haven’t been able to program much)",
  "2025-3-6": "Robotic was pretty productive today, programming has two people work on the navx2 and also the weird rev through board (supposed to detect the rotational speed and make it more precise). Got my bracket sent to fabwork and I really hope I didn’t mess it up with the dimension in real life since onshape may have been funky. Wanted to help out, but everything seemed like 2 or 3 people would do the job. Everything looks like it's going to be fine, I think we should be done with the robot by competition. Still haven’t had any drive practice on the robot, might just be a human player at this point. I'm gonna study the AP world now (not doing good so far).",
  "2025-3-7": "No robotics today and had a whole day worth of tests for spanish, algebra, and world history. Coming back home, there was so much traffic, it wasn't even funny. I finished my patrol meeting with my boy scout member and thought of what to bring for camporee and what to cook. I’m also thinking of making a blog for programming specifically cause I need some motivation on what I’m doing when programming and stuff. I think I’m going to start off easy and make a game like the Oregon Trail or something. Robotic tomorrow so I better sleep and not stay up late.",
  "2025-3-8": "Today the robot went and finished the tower bracket literally, everything is good and now we are working on the intake and cannon now. Everyone was wiring things well while I started cading and coding in my free time to help out. The tower was mounted and dismounted so many times I’m really about to crash out on where parts should be at. We solved the problem for the cannon however as we shrunk it to a 2x1 instead of a 2x2 so we could put a belt and gear for the motor. Overall today, I was pretty productive and had to stay til 8 to figure out the dimensions of the intake and stuff.",
  "2025-3-9": "Went to boyscout today and got to see the fire department vehicle and what was inside it. It was kinda cool seeing that most of the engine and truck is filled with ladders and hoes but also there were many first aid items such as a self-CPR machine for more precise rescue and more free hand. Got a bunch of cool accessories such as a helmet, keychain, and a bracelet. It was nice meeting department 12 since they also had different things that differ from other fire departments.\n\nHowever, for robotics many more wiring and designing the intake. Unfortunately it took most of robotic time to get the intake brackets hole to get cut off and figure out how to mount them. I personally CADed with a friend on another custom bracket which was a pain in the butt and it look like a block of triangle cheese, I guess we would see the result tomorrow if its any good. Hopefully we get our robot done in 3 days.",
  "2025-3-10": "Great, I have school today which was boring as alway. My Spanish grade hasn't changed and I still have an F. My Spanish teacher still hasn't changed my grade after a week which I’m kinda panicking cause I think “quarter grade” is going to be released.\n\nRobotic was kinda a pain since the intake as the bracket 3D print has failed which is not good. There is also a gear ratio problem to figure in because apparently we forgot to buy a gearbox for the intake arm which is bad since we have to expedite it. However we have good news, we got the brackets and other items that we have bought. We spray painted rust-proof my tower bracket design which would take until tomorrow to finish. So close to the robot being done … sort of.",
  "2025-3-11": "The AP world was pretty light, and I had to study about China and the cold war which was easy since I learned some parts about them already. For robotics, most of the mechanical team have “crash out” because a random person came in and tried to help but broke a piece of a gearbox that we need for the intake. Thankfully, we were able to fix it, but whoever came in robotic better watch their back cause I think the club member might be angry. My bracket seems pretty done and dry so we change the 3D printed bracket with the new ones. Couldn’t stay in the meeting because I had a zoom meeting for my merit badge that took pretty long. Better get some sleep and wake up early.",
  "2025-3-12": "Great, some idiot in our class made the Spanish teacher give us a test on Friday. And we have robotics until 10 because we aren’t done with it. Now that the tower is finished, we have to figure out where to put the intake and how the cannon is going to be placed. I say around 24 inches and people have started to have me CAD everything for them. I don’t really mind if I can do something. However, that means I don’t have time to study for the test on AP or Spanish so I hope that goes well. Stayed up until 10:30 and fell asleep right after I got home.",
  "2025-3-13": "Stayed up till 8 PM today to work on the robot then stayed until 10 PM to study. Very tired and sorry for the short note.",
  "2025-3-14": "No robotics for today since the people went to a competition for inspection. AP world I got lucky on the test, and started to study more on the MCQ and take practice. Also started to use the weird Magoosh app that the school pays for. Afterschool, I had to print some stuff in the library and I swear, the same button printed a different thing which was driving me nuts since it printed me out 5 black paper for 15 cents each. Also started watching a nice Chinese drama on Netflix and it seems interesting. Only started watching it cause the person played basketball and thought there would be a scene for that.",
  "2025-3-15": "Woke up at 5:30 in the morning today, getting ready for a robotic competition and seeing how the robot was when I wasn’t there. Apparently, I couldn't get the algae cannon going. However, there were many cool teams that were hella cool. Madtown had a crazy smooth coral and algae manipulation and the autonomous period was best. People like me had to scout in the morning and we didn’t get a great spot in the stance, hopefully tomorrow we get a better one. Autonomous for our robot but able to fix it which was good (it was me that helped out with that so yippee). Also surprised that an alumni from last year's robotic team came over and watched. Honestly, the dude is chill and yaps a lot about interesting things. One of our motors overheated and another team gave us a motor to borrow. Ended up 16 places today (last time I checked), wondering how we will do tomorrow. Maybe get the driving working and algae intake and processor tomorrow.",
  "2025-3-16": "Woke up at 5:50 today, I guess my alarm didn’t go off. Went to competition early again and got started in the stance scouting again. Kinda boring scouting, but when I’m not scouting and watching robots, now that was fun. To be real though, MadTown and Bread were absolute beasts in the playoffs. They for sure could have soloed all the team on the blue alliance. Unfortunately, we landed second to last place, but we will get our get back in East Bay Regional. Alliance selection was cool as always, but at the same time things are so unfair when the first pick second place. Had our intake working in SVR at least I guess. After the competition ended and an award was given out, I went out to get boba and clean up. Gonna go to sleep, hella tired.",
  "2025-3-17": "Went back to school, boring as hell. Had a test for Spanish which I did not like at all. Had to stay after school for robotics. We discussed how we should plan out the next 3 weeks until the next competition. Honestly, everyone thought the same thing during the circle as we didn’t do our best in the SVR competition. We all gathered up and had deadlines for what to do, such as finishing the ball cannon, cage mechanism, and programming new components.",
  "2025-3-18": "Today was alright, I started working on studying for another AP exam. Not like the AP world exam but future AP tests that the school doesn’t offer. Beginning of school, the robotics club discussed what to work on. As a programmer, my friend and I had to work on the new climber mechanism. I forgot to mention, but it would be a pneumatic shock type of cage mechanism. And also we never worked with pneumatics before so… it would be a challenge. We figured out however today that the pneumatic shock does not need to be programmed, which is nice. Had another boy scout meeting on citizenship in society which was long and I had to listen to a group of people talk. Nothing much and I finished the badge which is nice.",
  "2025-3-19": "Nothing much in school as always. Again, I started getting into other AP courses to study and just take the test. No need to take the classes if I could maybe self-study it. It was announced that we don’t have school on Friday which I totally forgot. That ment I had one less day to study and if you know me, I love splitting my time studying different topics and not cramming everything together everyday. That ment one hour less of robotics I guess since I can’t fail that test. Speaking of robotics, I got straight to work on the battery mount design and started 3 printing the first design and rushed the second one, hopefully everything came out right. (usually the first is bad and I have to do some revision, maybe not the best idea to print both)",
  "2025-3-20": "Yep, I got to cook in the AP test, rather only got one section of them correct with full points but the other side probably got 80% at best. Either way I could take it and I kinda forgot it was shifted to Thursday so I gave myself a little grace for once. However, the battery mount design, yeah, wasn’t exactly how I imagined. Ok, it was correctly printed in all dimensions and stuff, but I realized I could add more triangular support and have the battery rest on the mount rather than float  which would strain the 3D print part which would be bad cause it could break during competition. I reprinted it and I think the design I adjusted was great, very stable and approved by Issac and Joanna so great. I also applied myself into the annual ANova competition by Berkely, hoping to see some friends there and form a team. Tomorrow we don’t have school and I’m sure I'm looking forward to it.",
  "2025-3-21": "Took a break for today I guess, however my throat started to kill me. I started drinking a lot of water lately, maybe getting sick or something, but 5 bottles is more than I usually drink. Anyways, I went to the library and did some practice MCQ for the AP World exam which I thought I did pretty well. Shamefully, I had myself play bedwar for like an hour and a half which I couldn’t help myself with after winning after wins. Went to the park afterward where I played pick up basketball and honestly I was cooking. Printed my AP world packet for the day, but I honestly think today wasn’t as productive as I wanted, but tomorrow I will do better.",
  "2025-3-22": "Honestly, today I had the worst sleep of the year. I woke up every two hours for some reason. My head hurts and I bike to the library pretty early in the morning. I quickly bike to robotics before the meeting to check up on what is going on. Apparently gotta check the motor out and see what is wrong since two motors have been fried now. Also need to check up on the bumper and what EVA foam to buy. I was assigned to find the EVA foam after the meeting. Spent an hour figuring it out and checking the rule book with my half working brain, but managed it. However afterward, apparently our mentor already found out and doesn’t need it. Even worse news was my battery mount that I work hard on, also got replaced. Great. We got some drive practice done I guess and set up the gym to see what needs to be labeled and peel off.",
  "2025-3-23": "Uhh, I overslept today after yesterday's headache nightmare. Instead of waking up at 7 (I thought maybe I would get 8 hours of sleep), instead my parents woke me up and said it was 9. I was like, oh well maybe I didn’t oversleep so much. But when I checked my phone, it was 9:45. I rushed to get dressed and made my way to the park for my daily boy scout meeting. Nothing new was done except, making paper airplanes, 3 leg races, and a couple of knot tying. Got really boring since we didn’t know what else to do. So off to robotics and it seemed like everyone was testing out the motor. Found out that the intake doesn’t work very well because the bumper needs to be attached, but also that the bottom intake wheel won't spin or else it would be useless and the algae won’t go up. After CADing it out and eating lunch, there was an outreach meeting and it went pretty smoothly. Got back to doing nothing for a while until someone told me we need a motor to be tested and no one knew how to. Luckily I learned by watching and got a stuff test. Went straight to the motor problem that fried our motor 2 times already and I was ready to say it was the gearbox problem. But after reviewing and watching, it seems like the code was the problem since one of the gears was moving faster than the rest and also it was going the opposite direction. Didn’t get it fixed in time and I had a meeting with a boy scout which cut my time off. Hopefully we get the motor problem fixed soon.",
  "2025-3-24": "It's Monday and to start off the day, we had a new type of assignment for robotic grade this “quarter”. Starting now, we had to write in a good doc about what we are going to do this week and how to fix it. I decided to help out with the robot simulation, 3d print a new hex bracket, and figure out why the motor was fried. I got straight to work with the bracket as the person that made the bracket didn’t do the best job and all the dimensions apparently were made up. Barely got the bracket done and almost was late to my next class which was chem. During chem, we did an ACT practice on the science part and I thought it was too easy compared to the previous Pre-ACT practice. After school, I got the bracket done, but the design dimension was messed up again meaning I would have to fix it and reprint it tomorrow. For the motor frying, I believe it had something to do with the programming side of things, and in the end I saw that one of the codes had two of the same motor running, meaning one won’t be running at 40 AMP. I think I Flip up on this one.",
  "2025-3-25": "Welp, I took the Pre-ACT today and I’m kinda disappointed. For the Pre-ACT we had the same practice test like last time, meaning it was going to be boring and kinda lame. I thought we were going to get a different test, but on the bright side, after doing practice I could clearly see a huge improvement in the science section of the Pre-Act as I believe I got a lot of them correct (except the last which I realized I mess up and didn’t have time to fix it). For robotics however, I check my code and I expect myself to get jumped by the whole team. I think it was my code that got two motors fried, however and lucky, apparently testing it with the correct code also didn’t work. And we realized that it was a problem with another portion of the code that wasn’t entirely my fault so I’m safe for now. Hope to get some sleep and tomorrow I’m going to get 100 on that AP test I didn’t study much for.",
  "2025-3-26": "Nothing much in school today, my bracket seems to have been off again and I have to reprint them again tonight. Had my AP World grade score and I passed again. Also the teacher has started to give out MCQ practice so I think I’m going to do them soon. Kinda getting boring now so I’m going to leave it out of my blog. During robotics nothing much was done, they started to figure out where the battery would go and also I finished my simulation robot code which should work just fine.",
  "2025-3-27": "It’s Thursday and almost time for the OA induction camp, really kinda getting out of control as my time management starts to drive me insane. I always feel like I can’t handle time with things I would like to enjoy doing like watching some netflix or something. I don’t think I have time for that stuff anymore. Robotic again my bracket failed, apparently someone might have shook the 3D print which led to mis-alignment with the print and caused the whole print to be a disaster. Robotic, not much for me to step in except filing the bad 3D print for the last 20 minutes and realized in the end there wasn’t much to save and had to re-3D print. Came home early to study. Also shout out to a friend of mine that got into Harvard!",
  "2025-3-28": "It’s Friday and that means OA induction is coming up. I finished all my school work and now about to pack up for the induction. To be honest I can’t say anything about what is going to happen tomorrow during the OA induction because apparently I'm against doing it or else I won’t be able to get in OA. But I can say what happened tonight, as we got checked in, they served some snacks and a little drink. We waited until almost 10:30 and then we started going to sleep. Can't say how or where, but I went to sleep at 9 and would have to wake up at 6.",
  "2025-3-29": "Not going to say anything, but all I’m going to say is hungry, tired, and silent was what I felt during the induction process. Can’t say what happened so I’ll leave it at that, but I got my stash and everything seems good. However, it seems like it's going to rain at Wente camp, which is not good.",
  "2025-3-30": "Woke up early and very tired. I quickly clean up in the rain and pack my stuff. I put my stuff under a table and cover so my stuff didn’t get soaked while working. Good thing is that there was an umbrella in my pack which I was able to dry the whole process and leave early. I was thinking if I was going to be robotic, but I felt bored as hell so I went even though I was tired. I got to work on the PID controller as it was funky in the intake pivot, started to mess around with them and realized that the chain hitting the bracket might be a problem why the intake won’t go down smoothly, might have to extend the gearbox and motor or something. I think I miss the challenge robotic faces already.",
  "2025-3-31": "Today I stayed at home and shamefully watched for like 2 hours straight. Got a little work done and went to robotics at 2 PM. Apparently half the people in the robot were sick and only some people came. Apparently there wasn’t much to do and I just helped out with 3D printing the motor mount and got the thing to work. Wasn’t much to do as we had to wait for parts and materials. Hopefully more things are done tomorrow. Competition is coming soon.",
  "2025-4-1": "Back to school and being bored. Started working on my form for a program for the summer and I don’t think I’m going to get in, but I'm gonna try. I don’t like how I’m not good at one specific thing, like I know many people good at programming or math or art. I think I lack that type of thing, I’m more like a jack of all trades. Today it was robotic, not much to do again and test out the print for the bracket however it was illegal apparently because it was outside of the robot parameter :(",
  "2025-4-2": "Today, I had to solve the intake alignment issue and apparently something was off with the encoder. Apparently, some human error would change the value of degree of the absolute encoder which meant we needed a code or manuale change it every time for the auto alignment to work. I applied to another summer camp program and it would be for medical and science which would be cool. Only downside is when camp rolls around and I won’t have the internet for that time period. And for robotics, things aren’t looking the best, but I think we are getting there. The cannon is attached and my bracket finally works, and I think we are going to get the cage done. But most of the time in robotics today was kinda waiting for cannon or some other stuff to get done unfortunately.",
  "2025-4-3": "Welp, it's Thursday and nothing much to do again, however I got some code done for the intake and stuff, got working on changing the chain I believe so it doesn’t hit the bracket. I went out and dropped off stuff for Friday with 3 other robotic members and we got to see the pit and team early. Surprise (not) the Cheesy Poof (best team in FRC for most people) apparently have their own big tv for display and also two long displays and a great pit for mechanical organization. Compared to ours is like comparing diamond to copper. When I got back people started playing a silent game I guess and we did stay silent for a while until I told them that since our robot ain’t done we probably should be communicating to finish faster. In the end, we had “beverages” that made us wake up a lot. I didn’t drink any and stuck to water. Hope I can get some sleep ready for tomorrow's regular test.",
  "2025-4-4": "It’s Friday and school went by like it is. I started to get worse at studying which isn’t good, I need to get back into the habit. But last I checked for robotics, one of our neos got fried again which isn’t good. But I couldn't help it because I had a camporee coming up and had to pack up. It’s at rancho los mochos and I had to wait for everyone else in my patrol to start heading up. However, once ready we got up to the campsite and set up. I had my patrol make a flag pole for us that was like 15 feet tall and I think everyone at the campsite could see it. Maybe tomorrow I will make it even taller. Went to an all patrol leader meeting and all went well, can’t wait to compete tomorrow morning however.",
  "2025-4-5": "Competition day, yippee. In the beginning we had a morning flag and everyone had their flag and banner out to show out. I kinda messed up cause I forgot to get a sheet of paper that was given out of me yesterday and I had to write down events on my hands. Most event activity, I think we, as a patrol, did pretty well on. I really messed up on the compass event as my compass broke while my teammate was able to get a perfect score on it and I got a 75%. We cooked some pretty good food too during the camporee. Bacon and egg for breakfast, hamburger for lunch, and alfredo chicken for dinner. Campfire was nice too, we all had to present our skit which was interesting. Went to sleep at 11:30 cause I rode back at 9:30 to go to the robot tomorrow. Can’t wait to see how the top dog in robotics would present.",
  "2025-4-6": "Robotic was nice, a good feeling to be back to competition where there are cool robots to see. Honestly, the first thing I thought about the cheesy poof was the robot was kinda big and I didn’t expect it to be smooth. I think, personally, mad-town autonomous robots were way cooler and smaller too. The cheesy poof uses more algae manipulation than the madtown did however, I guess that was part of the strategy as most teams would score with coral. Overall, the competition was a lot of fun watching top robots compete and seeing what they use to solve the engineering challenge. Only thing that could have been better would be our team going to the playoffs. Hope I really get to sleep tonight.",
  "2025-4-7": "School was basically boring and self-taught. However, starting now, we are going to have a test on the world everyday which is really a bummer. I finished my student application for a program for summer now and hope to get in (most likely not going to happen, as some smarter student is going to apply). No robotics so we are taking a break from that. I’m going to improve the website animation and also work on a game with code and hopefully post it on the website. Really got to work on some coding practice or game.",
  "2025-4-8": "Wasn’t much to be done today again. Fixing up the website again and want to add some fancy CSS magic to it. Basically for robots, this season is basically over and everyone is chilling. We had some cleaning up and went over recruitment ideas for next school year. They also have plans for upcoming outreach events too as people sign up to participate in the tri-valley fair. I would be going to ANova hackathon, however. Other than that, today was much more than just fixing up the website and studying.",
  "2025-4-9": "Today not much was done again, just studying and working on extra curricular courses. I plan to have a fundraiser tomorrow and hopefully the office will reply on time, if not I would talk today tomorrow. We are going to sell cookies, Arizona, and chips. I also plan to update the site with new information since I’m taking over finance club and I need to update it on the site.",
  "2025-4-10": "Not going to lie, today was pretty fun in chemistry as we made personal airbags and I created the best design from a classroom vote. Today selling was very successful as we were able to sell out enough to pay for food actually bought. Came a little late, but still able to get things sold and all was good. No tests and stuff so today I chilled and watched some finance videos on S&P 500 and the type of thing to look out for when looking at stocks. Gonna study now for AP (AP world ain’t really that hard, just if you don’t study you would forget everything).",
  "2025-4-11": "Spring break is about to start and all I had to do was finish school. Had a fundraiser today and it went pretty well to be honest. I was able to pay off all the things I own and make $80 in profit. Wait until May when I’m going to be selling all sorts of stuff. Not much happened today again, but tomorrow is going to be the hackathon so that would be hella fun (I’m hoping we don’t stay overnight, but you never know).",
  "2025-4-12": "Today, I got ready for the hackathon and got all my tech charges up. I went to the library first to print all the AP world documents that we went to over the school year and met a couple of students in the library that were playing chess that was part of my club. I also bought myself a couple of eye drops before competition cause I know my eyes gonna get dry staring at the screen for so long. My friend and I were the first to get there and were waiting for our third guy. He said he didn’t get lost, but one of his classmates was there too and found him going the other direction of the street. We picked up a fourth person in the end and got straight to the game design. We are thinking of making a game where people would pick up trash and get upgraded while answering questions that would help them learn about sustainability in the environment. I went to a bunch of workshops and personally I loved the data science workshop as they gave examples of code and asked us to solve it. It was a really hands- on experience which I liked. It gave a foundation and insight to what I would be doing when I’m majoring in data science. We work all the way to 12 PM and make sprites for the game. Our fourth man was going to sleep and would wake up at 4 AM apparently. He really hasn't done much in the team which I was a little annoyed about.",
  "2025-4-13": "Still working after 12 guys. I was finalizing the CSS and HTML outline of the game and working on the shop upgrade section. Got working straight on the question as I forgot about that too. Apparently, the fourth guy still hadn't woken up yet and it was 4 AM. I was really stopping myself from having everyone jump on his sleeping bag. Everything seemed set and we were testing out the game with the bug and the guy, with all his nerves, slept till 9 then woke up. I was about to kick him out of the team, but couldn’t think of a way to do so politely. I wish I had done that because afterward he was on his phone and playing the piano when we were working. We officially finished around 11:30 and got the slide presented. The other team project was pretty creative. Many team created roblox game, one team created a red ball game design, another a website on solar system, two arduino design, one with AI figuring out what object goes to where (such as our question game where we ask if something goes to the compost, recycle, or trash), and one with a ad-blocker. When we went up to present, we kinda took the full 15 minutes going over the game and for some reason the final boss took more than 3 minutes to beat which was kinda annoying cause I swear it took 30 seconds last time I checked. Overall the competition was hella fun and we won the game award too which was a win. Gonna post the project we made on my website soon!",
  "2025-4-14": "Overslept today after not sleeping at all for more than 48 hours straight. Today I had it light as I just went to the library and printed out stuff and read some books. Not much on the computer or phone so my eyes can rest. I also started to use eye drops more since putting on eye drops makes my eyes seem to be more awake than usual. Went to the park and hooped on the “new” floor that they paved. It was fun going out and hooping again after so many months. Maybe tomorrow things will be more interesting.",
  "2025-4-15": "Overslept again, which is kinda a pain in the butt cause I went to sleep at 8. I guess that hackathon is really taking a toll on me. Today not much was done as I just self-studied again. Guess what I’m going to do in the next day or so. For the blog site, I’m thinking of making this writing into a pop up rather than have you guys click on google doc as that's lame as hell. Starting to learn how javascript DOM is like and hope I can implement this by the end of the week.",
  "2025-4-16": "Argh, I overslept again. Yeah not good. I’m starting to think that when I have work to do and think about a solution, it's probably not the best idea to memorize and solve it when sleeping. Anyways, today's study was pretty nice. I think I’m starting to get the hang of the MCQ part of it. I think I got more than 90% of the question correct this time which is very nice. After studying, I went to get my eye prescription and bought new glasses. Hopefully it looks good on me.",
  "2025-4-17": "Today was alright. I got more practice in the mcq and got started updating the website actually. I’m thinking instead of google doc, I’m going to make it appear with Javascript, yeah it's going to probably get messy the file is going to be huge. Not to mention, a lot of painful transfering. Either way, I’m going to have a javascript popup effect with CSS that would show and block when something is pressed on. I also started changing the color and customizing the appearance such as making the button round or the text more visible. Hope to add the new program that we made at ANova by tomorrow.",
  "2025-4-18": "Today, I finished making the page for the ANova game we made. Honestly, it was quite simple, however some small tweaks and changes to it made it kinda annoying, but it was pretty well done. In the library, I mostly worked on AP multiple choice questions and it was kinda of a shame I only improved slightly, and I averaged around the 75% area (8 questions wrong), which was kinda painful since I thought I would do better. Nothing much happened today except working.",
  "2025-4-19": "Today was pretty boring, nothing really happened. Went to study and read. Fixed up some bugs in my website and played around with the javascript. Nothing much was done today again.",
  "2025-4-20": "Early in the morning, I did the ice bucket challenge, presented by USC, great. First time experience with an ice bucket too which was an interesting feeling. Today, for boyscout I did my requirement ready to rank up to Life scout next week which is very nice. That means one more rank and 6 more months until I’ll be able to be promoted to Eagle. For lunch, I went to a new restaurant with my family today and had steak ribs, rice, and a-choy. Honestly, the steak ribs that my parents make are way better, the restaurant I went to didn’t have the favor of it (probably just pepper and a small amount of bbq sauce). Finish almost updating my blog page and final touches. I finished off the day with AP world studying and watching the warrior and rocket game replay.",
  "2025-4-21": "Went back to school, yippee. Apparently I forgot to study a unit in History class which I almost messed up on. School was light again and however, the limited thing I could do on a school computer is kinda frustrating. After school, I also forgot to attend the meeting for Boyscout at night until 30 minutes later, however, the meeting was kinda interesting. There were a lot of complaints about our troop which was kinda interesting again. There were also a lot of words from our troop player about those complaints too which I won’t get into. Overall, today I feel like everything wasn’t planned smoothly and hopefully tomorrow I do better.",
  "2025-4-22": "Today, school was alright, apparently we had a pop quiz on english, but it wasn’t too bad. Nothing done much today except finishing up slides for finance and studying up on AP world. Starting to get to school on bike lately and my leg starting to cramp up. Hopefully that isn’t an issue. As for the website, I need to find a way for a commenting system. I think I would leave the google form for comment and have it uploaded manually.",
  "2025-4-23": "Today was busier than usual. I finished my chemistry test and the funny thing is none of the same answer bubbles repeated twice in the MCQ (like there weren't two answers A in a row). Speaking of MCQ, I’m thinking of doing my AP World MCQ later this week after asking for them. My new glasses came in today which was nice cause my other ones were either broken or tilted so much. There are also so many meetings tonight it isn’t even funny. I finished my python lesson meeting tonight and honestly I was surprised that we are getting taught by a CSP student. I was thinking it was some other professor teaching, but again, what type of teacher has the time to teach at 7 PM? Hopefully my instructor knows what he is doing.",
  "2025-4-24": "Ok, I think I have everything set up for the blog pop-up rather than have you guys come to the google doc and view it which is lame as hell. Honestly, I think my javascript object is going to get so packed, it isn’t even funny. I’m also thinking of implementing a search feature for the blog, but not sure how to do that yet. Anyways, today was boring as usual and my finance club couldn’t run today as I forgot the junior having SBAC testing meaning I would not have a room to operate my club. Gonna have to study for Spanish and AP World now since I’ll have a double test tomorrow.",
  "2025-4-25": "Today was great to be honest, I finished both tests for Spanish and AP world. Finished my school homework assignment and the weekend is around the corner. After finishing school, I got back home to finish my python homework that I haven’t finished. Honestly, I was having a pain in the butt, debugging everything. All the solutions that I wanted to try didn't work because I’m limited in how to solve them. It took me like half an hour of thinking and 30 minutes to implement the code. Honestly, I didn’t like that one bit cause I should be doing better than that. Right now, I’m asking for some feedback on my code.",
  "2025-4-26": "Today, I went to robotics, and honestly, there wasn't much to do. All there was was cleaning up and planning. I helped out in making the 3D-printed desk seem cleaner and reorganized, where everything was. Afterward, I helped clean out the programming cabinet and to be frank, there seemed to be so much space after the clean-up. I also had to help sow back the broken computer backpack that we had. Honesty, I hope to help out in the robot more, but if this is what needs to be done, then so be it. Can't wait for the court of honor tomorrow morning for Boy Scouts. However, to rank up, I would need one more step until Eagle.",
  "2025-4-27": "Today, I went to Oakland and did my court of honor at the Lincoln Recreational Clubhouse. There wasn't much, just getting my Life Scout rank and celebrating our other scout ranking achievements. Now, I would have to find an Eagle Scout project to do. Hopefully, I'll get that done before summer. Afterward, there wasn't much done except I did MCQ practice on College Board, and after a little struggle in the beginning (I only got 11/15), I passed the rest of the MCQ practice with just getting one question wrong for each unit. Honestly, it wasn't bad; I expected a worse result. That reminds me, I haven't studied for the two unit tests tomorrow :<",
  "2025-4-28": "For school today, things were all right. I got my Spanish grade back up to an A+ which I really like (wanna keep the streak going). We were supposed to meet today, but our robotic teacher, Mr. K, was sick. I also hoped that MadTown was going to reply to our case study and I think that was false hope because I don't think they are going to answer any time soon. Instead, I told my team to try to contact the BREAD team, maybe it would go better, but I don't know. I'm also starting to implement Trello in my daily life to get things organized. I used it before (I wasn't a fan of it) and all big company has to keep themself organized, so might as well get used to using Trello.",
  "2025-4-29": "Today, I actually feel miserable. Nothing seems to go how I planned it. I have not much to say except that I selected my course for the 2025-2026 school year, and I have a CAST test for science tomorrow that I don't feel like studying for. I don't have much to say today, sorry. Hopefully tomorrow is better.",
