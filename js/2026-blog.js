  "2026-1-1": "Happy new year! Everyone, went out to Fusion Delight with my family to celebrate the start of 2026. The food was decent and wasn't anything amazing, but it is what it is. I would say it again, it crazy how I blogged every single day last year and still keep at it. Hopefully in the future I can review this and see how I have change and done over my life.",
  "2026-1-2": "Not much have been done today, I just relaxed and I think I'm going to resume making video on SAT tomorrow. Gotta keep up the grind on video so I actually practice before my next exam, cause no way I'm trying to get screwed up in the english section again.",
  "2026-1-3": "Went and hoop with a old frined and had a good time getting to know whats up with each other again. Nothing much happen afterward and that day was mostly studying for AP Statistics. Might need to revert back to Econ soon. Got my SAT video done today too.",
  "2026-1-4": "Can't believe that all the AP I'm taking would add up to $200. If I don't do well on them, then my parent might disown me lol. But aside that, today was raining pretty hard and nothing happen much except I was able to return my book and borrow it again to study. Other than thats, same as always.",
  "2026-1-5": "Home alone, and I got school tomorrow, just great. Nothing much happen except me figuring out a POS system for my club and uploading video on SAT. I'm gonna start creating video for my stat channel soon, but I'm probably gonna do a bunch of video first then upload a playlist of unit of AP Stat reviews. I wonder if me actually teaaching would get me some subscriber, but mostly its for me to do a quick refresher months ahead of ap exam and they do say \"the best way to learn is to teach\" or something like that.",
  "2026-1-6": "I finally was able to get my idea around an app I wanted to design and launch. I was able to get a friend onboard and hoping to find a UI/UX designer and hopefully a secondary programmer. I haven't thought of a name for it yet, but I definitely want it to be well known and catchy.",
  "2026-1-7": "Still thinking about asking who to join. School was alright so far.",
  "2026-1-8": "I found my secondary and UI designer. I told them about my app thought in CSP and they seem pretty onboard with it. Hopefully they actually go with the flow and not dip like midway. I do have the upmost faith in them as they are great human being.",
  "2026-1-9": "Got school off, so I decided for my new app development team to huddle on a chat to have them know what they are signing up for. Pretty obvious, but I was going to be our PM and Q&A for this app. We went on a discord call for around 30 minute which I was able to get some point pointed out and collect some idea. I also introduce them to Trello and add them card to do. We decided to meet up on Sunday for two hours and get some work done.",
  "2026-1-10": "Rebuild season is here. Man I also got a reply from the linkedin guy that I text about creating app which was intresting as there is many platform that I didn't consider back then. Going back to rebuild season, the game this year, I love it. Its so offensive, so much point inflation in the game.I was thinking of having a crazy bulldozer mechanism, but it was quickly shut down and it kinda made sense. Thinking of being a coach again for the drive team this year",
  "2026-1-11": "Welp, apparently, I found my marketing ammbassador for my app developement team. I didn't have much option and I wanted to find a person that is probably to around the area so I ask up an old friend that moved. I was honestly suprise that she want in so I invited her to our first meeting. The first meeting for SOText wasn't so bad. I first go the programmer to settle down first and figure out what they were getting into, then hop in and fill in my new marketing ammbassador, and then go to UI and fill her in. It was pretty organized and it was nice too catching up with my old friend last I talked to her.",
  "2026-1-12": "School, boring. Nothing happen much, but I did make myself finish some work for SOText as I had to get the screen done for my UI designer.",
  "2026-1-13": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day.",
  "2026-1-14": "Bruh, somehow our team account was for SOText have been disable for misconduct. I swear I didn't do anything and I believe my team didn't do anything dumb too. I just finish CAD design for the shooter mechanism which isn't bad since I basically did it solo with a little help from mechanical lead, but mostly it was all me.",
  "2026-1-15": "Lowkey, not much was done for the shooter mechanism since we are waiting for part and other material. I was able to finsh the CAD design and got started on prototyping the shooter mechanism so it wasn't so bad.",
  "2026-1-16": "Not much happen at school except I took the practice SBAC and also miss like 2 question on the test for robotic. Other than that, today was simple and nothing much. ",
  "2026-1-17": "Robotic and nothing much. Had some time prototyping the robot mechanism for the shooter but we only launched it with a drill and it didn't go far at all. We also decided on project lead, basically the role of understanding your mechanism and calling the last shot, and I volunteer to be one.We had a meeting in the end and it was mainly on what the design was, and we weren't able to decided since all of our componet were too big to fit in the chassis.",
  "2026-1-18": "Today for boyscout, we went on a 9 mile hike. Yeah, it was a pain in the leg and it went on until like 5. Nothing to eat except two piece of bread and some water. When I got back I had to to a meeting with robotic on discussing the robot design, and in the end we couldn't decided on anything and decided to just get design and stick them together. Also had my second meeting for SOText and we didn't go on for too long, I'm thinking of cutting the time down and just use Sunday as a catch up and check in day.",
  "2026-1-19": "Nothing much had happen, I have check up with my app dev team again to let them understand the changes in our meeting schedule and then went out to hoop for a while been a while since I did that.",
  "2026-1-20": "Just did my exam for AP calc and it was alright. For robotic we started making design and I decided on making a two shooter design similar to WCP design",
  "2026-1-21": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day.",
  "2026-1-22": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day. However, we did decided on what type of robot mechanism we are going to design, still give PTSD about last year robot which took longer to design than it should have.",
  "2026-1-23": "Got the pep-rally for today and did bunch of CADing and BOM for robotic, a pain in the butt.",
  "2026-1-24": "Went to robotic today, got some 3D printing early, but afterward I went to the dentist and realized coming back that we had bad news about our robot. Our mentor had suggested us to 3D print the turret rather than just buying it. It kinda made sense because the turrent was back-order and also ",
  "2026-1-25": "Boyscout meeting today and we practice marching. Yep, it was kinda humiliatig to have",
  "2026-1-26": "Totally forgot that we had SBAC testing for AP Lang,",
  "2026-1-27": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day.",
  "2026-1-28": "Welp, half the class ain't here. Most of the people have went out and protest against ICE. Lowkey I would have too with my friends, but I had to go to school since education is more important. Maybe if it was outside of school time I would have. I did do my AP classroom for calc and honestly it was a little challenging then before and lowkey I should have solve them way faster. I think I might be not use to them thats all.",
  "2026-1-29": "Today I had my fundraiser. Honestly it wasn't the best for multiple reason. I didn't expect to be paired up with two clubs powerhouses which was not expected. Not only API was there, but Raicas too. It was a crazy choice I made but I decided to lower my price and only generated around $20 profit. We did have two boxes of chips left over, but with that our revenue was not the same which isn't good. I think the best course of action now is to be able to get more quanity and sell for less when going against popular clubs.",
  "2026-1-30": "Bruh, after all that and Friday nearly 2/3 of the school have left for the walkout. Lokwkey I just hooped for 3 hours and finish my SBAC that all that happened. In the end, the school ended early and I went back home and finished up some homework to rest in the weekend.",
  "2026-1-31": "Robotic, and week 3 or something like that. Nothing much happen which isn't good, I got 3D printed part semi-mounted together and finally we bought our turrent oshcut orders. Welp gonna wait like for another week for part to arrive then start coding and start building. Dumb and wasteful, but we are still alive and moving. I swear if next year is like this, I won't be able to keep this up any longer",

  "2026-2-2": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day.",
  "2026-2-3": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day.",
  "2026-2-4": "Today was pretty chill, a typical school day.",
  "2026-2-5": "Yep, I have done it now. I email the whole school and hope for a reply from them for my startup idea survey. I was a little nervous at first, but I think I would get at least some feedback. Welp, that was not the case, by the end of the day I was only able to get like 16 responses, not well since there was 620+ students in the school. I was kinda surprised that I got so few, I was expecting around 60ish at least (two classroom full)",
  "2026-2-6": "I took the advice from a teacher that I didn't have before (though I get along with him well). I basically email the whole school again. Yep, I got some balls to do that and it actually worked. I got like 50+ response which is not the best, but also better than yesterday. I do need to filter some of the responses because I know some of those guys just randomly selected answer choices for fun",
  "2026-2-7": "Went to robotic for a while then I went to Lincoln square park to do some work on the practicing the dragon dance for the festival on the 28th. They made us run a lot and everything which was kinda tiring but other than that the day was fine.",
  "2026-2-8": "Welp, Happy Birthday to me. Funny thing is I also realized that today was super bowl day. I had my bet on the seahawks since they crushed the SF 49ers during the playoff or something. And I was correct on the pridiction. Lowkey I was disapointed in the QB for the patirots since he started throwing throws after like half-time. Bad Bunny was kinda sick for the half time shows and his music was lite. Now that I think of that, I don't think I ever remember any NFL half-time show were the music wasn't english (well they did also put lady gaga after Bad Bunny, which was confusing). But overall the day was nice, I also had macha cake which taste great.",
  "2026-2-9": "I emailed the school one last time and I think I call it a day after that, I need to start to figure out the cleaning and filtering process of the 90+ responses I got.",
  "2026-2-10": "Not much happen at school today tbh",
  "2026-2-11": "Not much happen at school today tbh",
  "2026-2-12": "I did my skit for our SOText video for blue ocean. My team and I decided to compete in this competition and see if we can win. Even if we don't win their isn't anything to lose and everything to gain, that's how I think anyways. I did the video during robotic period and I didn't really mind either since no one showed up in robotic that day. Honestly, I think the team might be cooked but we'll see",
  "2026-2-13": "Calc test today and honestly I thought it wasn't too bad until I found out later that I fu-ked up pretty bad. I think I had like 4-5 point miss and I'm really screwed now. I had the idea and formula in my head by when saying it outloud in my head, my brain turn the other direction and did other math. Yeah my head isn't straight.",
